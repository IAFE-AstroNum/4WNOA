## Public Transportation

The university campus is served by several bus lines: 28, 33, 37, 42, 45, 107,
160 . Some buses end their route before reaching the University campus. Only
those with a special sign "Ciudad Universitaria" behind the windshield serve
the Workshop site. You should step down from the bus at the first stop inside
campus. All bus routes end at their third stop inside campus.

The bus fare must be paid aboard using a card called "SUBE" that you can
acquire (and charge with credit) in the metro stations or some post offices.

Please, bear in mind that at rush hours the trip to the campus may last an
hour.

## Arrival

Most international flights arrive at the Ezeiza International Airport, while
domestic flights arrive at Aeroparque.

A bus company ([Manuel Tienda Leon](http://www.tiendaleon.com/home/)) offers
transportation to downtown Buenos Aires and the ride takes about 40 minutes.
There are also public transportation buses that serve downtown Buenos Aires at
a cheaper rate, but we do not recommend it if you carry a significant amount of
luggage.
