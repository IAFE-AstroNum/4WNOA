## Venue

### Buenos Aires

Buenos Aires is the capital and largest city of Argentina, and the second
largest metropolitan area in South America. Buenos Aires is a top tourist
destination, and is known for its European-style architecture, rich cultural
life, exquisite cuisine, legendary nightlife, and fashionable shopping. You can
check out more information about what Buenos Aires has to offer at the Official
Tourism Site of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires or also at Wikipedia. 

Maps of the city (including public transportation) are available here.

### Workshop Location

The workshop will be held at the IAFE (Institute for research in Astronomy and
Astrophysics.). The IAFE is located at the University of Buenos Aires Campus
("Ciudad Universitaria")

The university campus is served by several bus lines: 28, 33, 37, 42, 45, 107,
160. Some buses end their route before reaching the University campus. Only
those with a special sign "Ciudad Universitaria" behind the windshield serve
the Workshop site. You should step down from the bus at the first stop inside
campus. All bus routes end at their third stop inside campus.

The bus fare must be paid aboard using a card called "sube" that you can
acquire (and charge with credit) in the metro stations or some post offices.

Please, bear in mind that at rush hours the trip to the campus may last an
hour.

### Arrival

Most international flights arrive at the Ezeiza International Airport, while
domestic flights arrive at Aeroparque.

A bus company (Manuel Tienda Leon) offers transportation to downtown Buenos
Aires and the ride takes about 40 minutes. There are also public transportation
buses that serve downtown Buenos Aires at a cheaper rate, but we do not
recommend it if you carry a significant amount of luggage.
